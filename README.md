# TheNyansaComplete
App to call to Nyansa API.

Use this application to peruse your Nyansa system from the convenience of your mobile device. Search for a key word, and a list of access points and clients will be returned. Each of these items can be expanded to explore access point/client device information, and to see a list of everybody connected to each radio of an access point.

Requires a valid api token and hosted Nyansa server, but you if you do not have either you can explore a sample one!
